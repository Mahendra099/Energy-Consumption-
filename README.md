Energy Consumption Analysis: Daily, Monthly, &amp; Anomaly Detection
Introduction:
Welcome to the Daily Energy Consumption Analysis repository, where we unravel the intricacies of energy usage, from daily consumption to monthly trends. Our powerful toolkit employs data-driven techniques to identify outliers and calculate average energy consumption per meter, enabling more informed and efficient energy management strategies.

Key Features:

Daily Energy Consumption: Our algorithms provide a granular view of energy usage on a daily basis. By aggregating and visualizing data, you can pinpoint peak consumption periods, aiding load distribution planning and optimizing energy utilization.

Monthly Energy Consumption: Discover overarching trends and patterns by analyzing energy usage on a monthly scale. Unearth seasonal variations and identify potential areas for energy-saving initiatives, supporting sustainable practices.

Anomaly Detection: Leveraging statistical methods and machine learning techniques, we detect outliers or anomalies in energy consumption patterns. Unusual spikes or drops can signify inefficiencies or abnormalities, guiding remedial actions.

Meter-specific Analysis: Gain insights into energy consumption on a per-meter basis. Calculating the average energy usage per meter helps identify high-consumption devices or areas, facilitating targeted interventions and conservation efforts.
